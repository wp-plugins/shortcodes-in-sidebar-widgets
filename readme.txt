Shortcodes in Sidebar Widgets plugin allows shortcodes to properly execute when they are used in sidebar text widgets.

Shortcodes in Sidebar Widgets plugin adds a light-weight filter which will allow shortcodes to properly execute when used in sidebar text widgets.  All that is needed is to download, install and activate.  I have found this plugin extremely useful for placing things like contact forms and other shortcode enabled features in sidebars
		

== Installation ==

You can install Shortcodes in Sidebar Widgets directly from the WordPress admin panel. Visit the Plugins > Add New page and search for 'Shortcodes in Sidebar Widgets'. Click to automatically install.  Once installed, activate and it is functional.
